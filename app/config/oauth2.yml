#HWI resource owners
hwi_oauth:
    # name of the firewall in which this bundle is active, this setting MUST be set
    firewall_name: secured_area

    # an optional setting to configure a query string parameter which can be used to redirect
    # the user after authentication, e.g. /connect/facebook?_destination=/my/destination will
    # redirect the user to /my/destination after facebook authenticates them.  If this is not
    # set then the user will be redirected to the original resource that they requested, or
    # the base address if no resource was requested.  This is similar to the behaviour of
    # [target_path_parameter for form login](http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/cookbook/security/form_login.html).
    # target_path_parameter: _destination

    # here you will add one (or more) configurations for resource owners
    # and other settings you want to adjust in this bundle, just checkout the list below!
