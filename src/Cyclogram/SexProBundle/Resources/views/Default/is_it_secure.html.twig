In addition, you do not need                to call to make an appointment, walk in the door, or wait in a                lobby where others may see you.</p>              <h3>Am I at greater risk of someone discovering sensitive                information by using ProofPilot compared to other research                venues?</h3>              <p>No.&nbsp; We must comply with the same rules and regulations                adhered to by other research and healthcare organizations. Read                the consent information carefully when you join a study to                ensure you understand what risks and rewards you may be                undertaking specific to each study. </p>              <h2>                <meta charset="utf-8">              </h2>              <h3>What exactly do you mean by <em>confidential</em>?</h3>              <p>You may have heard of anonymous research studies.&nbsp; In                those cases, you do not provide any identifying information.                With the Internet, anonymity is very difficult to achieve. IP                addresses, usernames, passwords, logins – this is all                identifying information. ProofPIlot makes participation in                research studies confidential.&nbsp; Any data you provide to                ProofPilot will stay completely encrypted - strictly                confidential.&nbsp; Make sure you carefully read the consent                information for the specific study you are joining to understand                how your data will be used. </p>              <h3>What information do you collect and why?</h3>              <p>ProofPilot collects information on behalf of research studies.                This information spans a wide perspective – everything from                sexual habits, to weight, to how much money you make each                year.&nbsp; The exact data we collect depends on the research                study goals.&nbsp; Make sure you read the specific study consent                information carefully before joining a study to understand                exactly what kinds of data are being collected.&nbsp;</p>              <h3>Most sites don’t ask for a mobile phone number. Why does                ProofPilot?</h3>              <p>To increase security, ProofPilot uses dual-factor                authentication. We ask that you use your username and a                password, like any other site, to log into the system. However,                to increase security, we then send you a random four-digit code                by SMS text message. You must enter that code before getting                access to the site. We may also use this number to call you in                case we need to speak with you personally.&nbsp;</p>              <h3>Who has access to my data?</h3>              <p>                When you choose to participate in a research study, you are                choosing to share your data (based on the terms and conditions                of the study available in the consent information) with a                research organization using the ProofPilot infrastructure to                help manage their effort. The name of that research organization                is identified on the study homepage.&nbsp; It will have access                to your data. </p>              <p>                <meta charset="utf-8">              </p>              <h3>How secure is my data? </h3>              <p>ProofPilot takes a security-first approach. ProofPilot houses                your data in an encrypted form on a dedicated server separate                from the website and the Internet via advanced firewalls. We                always transmit personal and financial information via industry                standard secure socket layer technology, preventing potential                malicious hackers from accessing data while it is being                transmitted.&nbsp; </p>              <h3>How can I protect my account?</h3>              <p>                ProofPilot goes to great lengths to protect your data. There are                some things you can do to make it even safer: </p>              <ul>                <li>Choose a complex password with letters and numbers, and                  don’t share it with anyone. </li>                <li>Make sure you have virus protection software on any computer                  that you use to access ProofPilot.</li>                <li>Be wary about installing programs from companies that you                  are not familiar with.</li>                <li>If you receive an email from ProofPilot that seems                  suspicious, contact us immediately and report it. It could be                  another organization posing as ProofPilot. .</li>              </ul>              <h3>What happens to my data if I close my account or I’m finished                with ProofPilot’s services? </h3>              <p>If you close your account, your data remains housed on the                secure servers as an inactive participant for up to three years.                Your data will stay on the server in an encrypted format and it                will not be shared with anyone.</p>            </div>            <aside class="text_page_styles">              <div class="box">                <h3>About Proofpilot</h3>                <p>ProofPilot is a platform to create, manage, and participate                  in online research studies.
